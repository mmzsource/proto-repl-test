`keymap.cson`:

```
# Your keymap
#
# Atom keymaps work similarly to style sheets. Just as style sheets use
# selectors to apply styles to elements, Atom keymaps use selectors to associate
# keystrokes with events in specific contexts. Unlike style sheets however,
# each selector can only be declared once.
#
# You can create a new keybinding in this file by typing "key" and then hitting
# tab.
#
# Here's an example taken from Atom's built-in keymap:
#
# 'atom-text-editor':
#   'enter': 'editor:newline'
#
# 'atom-workspace':
#   'ctrl-shift-p': 'core:move-up'
#   'ctrl-p': 'core:move-down'
#
# You can find more information about keymaps in these guides:
# * http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#_customizing_keybindings
# * http://flight-manual.atom.io/behind-atom/sections/keymaps-in-depth/
#
# If you're having trouble with your keybindings not working, try the
# Keybinding Resolver: `Cmd+.` on macOS and `Ctrl+.` on other platforms. See the
# Debugging Guide for more information:

## Keep a trail

- Setup Atom (see previous paragraph)
- Created this leiningen project with `lein new app proto-repl-test`
- add proto-repl dependencies for code completion: [proto-repl "0.3.1"] [proto-repl-charts "0.3.2"]

- Start repl `alt-cmd-L` This start a repl (and loads project dependencies). Repl instructions are given:

```ascii
REPL Instructions

Code can be entered at the bottom and executed by pressing shift+enter.

Try it now by typing (+ 1 1) in the bottom section and pressing shift+enter.

Working in another Clojure file and sending forms to the REPL is the most efficient way to work. Use the following key bindings to send code to the REPL. See the settings for more keybindings.

ctrl-alt-, then b
Execute block. Finds the block of Clojure code your cursor is in and executes that.

ctrl-alt-, s
Executes the selection. Sends the selected text to the REPL.

You can disable this help text in the settings.
Starting REPL with lein in /Users/mmz/Projects/proto-repl-test
```

- Navigate to `core.clj`
- send `ns` block to repl
- send `-main` block to repl
- type `(-main)` and send it to the repl

## Project notes

With all weights activated some strange predictions were made. For instance:
the best weight curve fit for :WOL in GER resulted was increasing descend. That's
not strange if you look at the data: 15 5 1 8 15 8 11 5 2 8 16. Predicting the '16'
would be best if the first value '15' would have a lot of weight. But then the
new prediction would add a lot of weight to the '5' result, which probably results
in a bad prediction.

There are 2 things going on here:

1. I cannot logically explain what would be going on with a team that has a
   increasing descend
2. I probably need to get rid of the weights lookup table and replace it with
   the (bezier) formula they were derived from. Then the first '15' value would
   also be used in the new-position-prediction (then again: would 'what
   happened 11 years ago' really have this kind of weight? I don't think so.)

The frequencies of best-predictors with all weights on:

[:ia1 35] [:id1 10] [:v1 7] [:id2 4] [:dd1 3] [:ia3 2] [:da4 2] [:h1 2] [:la1 2] ...

The underlying data:

(sort-by val >
  (frequencies
    (mapcat
      vals
      [{:EXC :v1, :UTR :ia1, :ROD :ia1, :WIL :v1, :AZA :dd1, :HEA :ia1, :HEE :ia1,
        :PSV :h1, :VIT :ia1, :GRO :da4, :NAC :ia1, :SPR :id2, :ADO :ia1, :TWE :v1,
        :PEC :da3, :VVV :v3, :FEY :ia1, :AJA :id2}
       {:HSV :ia1, :BAY :ia1, :TSG :id1, :LEP :ia1, :LEV :id1, :DOR :ia1, :STU :ia1,
        :MON :da1, :WER :v1, :WOL :id1, :HAN :ia1, :MAI :id4, :SGE :dd1, :AUG :la1,
        :BER :v1, :SCH :da2, :FRE :da4, :KOE :ia1}
       {:SWA :v2 :BRI :ia1, :STK :h1, :BUR :ia1, :MCI :la1, :WHU :v1, :LIV :id2,
        :NEW :ia1, :ARS :id1, :TOT :ia1, :CRY :ia1, :HUD :dd1, :SOU :ia1,
        :EVE :h3, :LEI :ia1, :BOU :ia1, :WAT :ia1, :WBA :ia1, :CHE :id1,
        :MUN :ia1}
       {:VIL :v1, :ALV :ia1, :EIB :ia1, :SOC :ia1, :BET :ia2, :VAL :ia1,
        :ESY :id1, :CLV :ia3, :LAP :ia1, :GET :ia1, :SEV :id1, :REA :id1,
        :LEG :ia1, :COR :la2, :LVT :id2, :MLA :id1, :ATM :ia1, :GIR :ia1,
        :FCB :id1, :ATB :ia3}])))

The high number of :ia1 curves as best predictor makes sense.
Results of the last couple of years are *the* most important predictors.
Looking into the high number of :id1 cases, I see a pattern: these are mostly
teams with a 'strange' position last year compared to the years before (like :WOL).
But since I cannot logically explain what would be going on with a team that has
such a weight curve as logical predictor, I did another test.

I'm going to calculate with only 4 weight curves

- horizontal (the mean is the best predictor if you have absolutely no other info)
- increasing ascend (last couple of years are *the* most important predictors)
- linear ascend (same as prediction last year which wasn't too bad)
- decreasing ascend (team is performing different, but stable
  last years compared to the years before that.)

Then the frequencies turn into this:

([:ia1 42] [:hor 17] [:da1 9] [:la1 8])

The underlying data:

(sort-by val >
  (frequencies
    (mapcat
      vals
      [{:EXC :ia1, :UTR :ia1, :ROD :ia1, :WIL :ia1, :AZA :da1, :HEA :ia1,
        :HEE :ia1, :PSV :da1, :VIT :ia1, :GRO :la1, :NAC :ia1, :SPR :hor,
        :ADO :ia1, :TWE :la1, :PEC :da1, :VVV :da1, :FEY :ia1, :AJA :ia1}
       {:HSV :ia1, :BAY :ia1, :TSG :hor, :LEP :ia1, :LEV :hor, :DOR :ia1,
        :STU :ia1, :MON :da1, :WER :hor, :WOL :hor, :HAN :ia1, :MAI :hor,
        :SGE :hor, :AUG :la1, :BER :ia1, :SCH :da1, :FRE :la1, :KOE :ia1}
       {:SWA :da1, :BRI :ia1, :STK :da1, :BUR :ia1, :MCI :la1, :WHU :ia1,
        :LIV :hor, :NEW :ia1, :ARS :hor, :TOT :ia1, :CRY :ia1, :HUD :la1,
        :SOU :ia1, :EVE :hor, :LEI :ia1, :BOU :ia1, :WAT :ia1, :WBA :ia1,
        :CHE :hor, :MUN :ia1}
       {:VIL :ia1, :ALV :ia1, :EIB :ia1, :SOC :ia1, :BET :ia1, :VAL :ia1,
        :ESY :hor, :CLV :la1, :LAP :ia1, :GET :ia1, :SEV :hor, :REA :hor,
        :LEG :ia1, :COR :da1, :LVT :hor, :MLA :hor, :ATM :ia1, :GIR :ia1,
        :FCB :hor, :ATB :la1}])))

  On top of these 4 weight curves, I would love to plugin 1 more prediction:
  simple linear regression and compare it with these results.

The plan:

;; Convert Raw Data to Team:
;; [:PSV "PSV" [1 1 4 3 3 3 2 4 1 1 3]]

;; Predict last position for team with different weight curves
;; {:da1 2.33}
;; {:da1 2.33, :ia1 2.35}
;; {:da1 2.33, :ia1 2.35 :hor 2.24}
;; {:da1 2.33, :ia1 2.35 :hor 2.24 :la1 2.14}

;; Predict last position with simple linear regression:
;; {:da1 2.33, :ia1 2.35 :hor 2.24 :la1 2.14 :slr 2.03}

;; Find best predictor of last position:
;; {:da1 2.33, :ia1 2.35 :hor 2.24 :la1 2.14 :slr 2.03 :best :ia1}
;; {:PSV :ia1}

;; Predict new position with best predictor:
;; {:PSV 2.55}

;; Sort together with other teams

Update: plan worked. But the linear regression is sometimes a bit too eager.
Must build in some safety valves. Then it's done :)
